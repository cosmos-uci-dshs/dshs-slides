# Hypothesis Testing

### Dr. Babak Shahbaba

]


---

### Hypothesis

- In general, many scientific investigations start by expressing a
{hypothesis}. 
- For example, Mackowiak et al (1992) hypothesized that the average normal (i.e., for healthy people) body
temperature is less than the widely accepted value of
`\(98.6F\)`. 
- If we denote the population mean of normal
body temperature as `\(\mu\)`, then we can express this hypothesis as $\mu
&lt; 98.6$.

---

### Null and alternative hypotheses

- The null hypothesis usually reflects the *status quo* or *nothing of interest*. 
- In contrast, we refer to our hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis we are investigating through a scientific study) as the *alternative hypothesis* and denote it as~$H_{A}$.
- For hypothesis testing, we focus on the null hypothesis since it tends to be simpler. 


---

### Null and alternative hypotheses

- Consider the body temperature example, where we want to examine the null hypothesis `\(H_{0}: \mu = 98.6\)` against the alternative hypothesis `\(H_A: \mu &lt; 98.6\)`. 
- To start, suppose that `\(\sigma^{2} = 1\)` is known.
- Further, suppose that we have randomly selected a sample of 25 healthy people from the population and measured their body temperature.


---

### Hypothesis testing for the population mean

- To decide whether we should reject the null hypothesis, we quantify the
empirical support (provided by the observed data) against the null
hypothesis using some statistics. 

- We use statistics to evaluate our
hypotheses. 

- We refer to them as *test statistics*. 

- For a statistic to be considered as a test statistic, its sampling
distribution must be fully known (exactly or approximately) under the
null hypothesis. 

- We refer to the distribution of test statistics under
the null hypothesis as the *null distribution*. 


---

### Hypothesis testing for the population mean

- To evaluate hypotheses regarding the population mean, we use the sample mean `\(\bar{X}\)` as the test statistic.
`$$\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}   \sim  N\bigl(\mu, \sigma^{2}/n\bigr).
\end{equation*}$$`

- For the above example, 
`$$\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}   \sim  N\bigl(\mu, 1/25\bigr).
\end{equation*}$$`

- If the null hypothesis is true, then
`$$\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}   \sim  N\bigl(98.6, 1/25\bigr).
\end{equation*}$$`


---

### Hypothesis testing for the population mean

- In reality, we have one value, `\(\bar{x}\)`, for the sample mean. 

- We can use this value to quantify the evidence of departure from the null
hypothesis. 

- Suppose that from our sample of 25 people we find that the sample mean
is `\(\bar{x} = 98.4\)`. 


---

### Hypothesis testing for the population mean

- To evaluate the null hypothesis `\(H_{0}: \mu = 98.6\)`
versus the alternative `\(H_{A}: \mu &lt; 98.6\)`, we use the lower tail
probability of this value from the null distribution.

---

### Observed significance level

- The *observed significance level* for a test is the probability of values
as or more extreme than the observed value, based on the null
distribution in the direction supporting the alternative hypothesis. 

- This probability is also called the `\(p\)`-*value*}* and denoted `\(p_{\mathrm{obs}}\)`.

- For the above example, 
`$$\begin{equation*}
p_{\mathrm{obs}} = P(\bar{X}  \le \bar{x} | H_{0}),
\end{equation*}$$`


---

### z-score

In practice, it is more common to use the standardized version of the
sample mean as our test statistic. 
- We know that if a random variable is
normally distributed (as it is the case for `\(\bar{X}\)`), subtracting the
mean and dividing by standard deviation creates a new random variable
with standard normal distribution,
`$$\begin{equation*}
Z   \sim  N(0,  1).
\end{equation*}$$`

---

### z-score

- We refer to the standardized value of the observed test statistic as
the `\(z\)`-*score*,
`$$\begin{eqnarray*}
z  &amp; = &amp; \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}},\\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{98.4 - 98.6}{0.2} = -1.
\end{eqnarray*}$$`

---

### z-test

- We refer to the corresponding hypothesis test of the
population mean as the `\(z\)`-*test*. 

- In a `\(z\)`-test, instead of comparing
the observed sample mean `\(\bar{x}\)` to the population mean according to
the null hypothesis, we compare the `\(z\)`-score to 0.

### Interpretation of `\(p\)`-value


- The `\(p\)`-value is the conditional probability of extreme values (as or
more extreme than what has been observed) of the test statistic assuming that the null hypothesis is true. 

- When the `\(p\)`-value is small, say 0.01 for example, it is rare to find values as extreme as what we have observed (or more so). 

- As the `\(p\)`-value increases, it indicates that there is a good chance to find more extreme values (for the test statistic) than what has been observed. 

- Then, we would be more reluctant to reject the null hypothesis.

- A common \textbf{mistake} is to regard the `\(p\)`-value as the probability of null given the observed test statistic:
`\(P(H_{0} | \bar{X} = \bar{x})\)`. 


---

### One-sided vs. two-sided hypothesis testing


- The alternative hypothesis `\(H_{A}: \mu &lt; 98.6\)` or `\(H_{A}: \mu &gt; 98.6\)` are called *one-sided* alternatives. 
- For these hypotheses, `\(p_{\mathrm{obs}} = P(Z \le z)\)` and `\(p_{\mathrm{obs}} = P(Z \ge z)\)` respectively.
- In contrast, the alternative hypothesis `\(H_{A}: \mu \ne 98.6\)` is *two-sided*. 
- For the above three alternatives, the null hypothesis is the same, `\(H_{0}: \mu = 98.6\)`
- In this case, `\(p_{\mathrm{obs}} = 2 \times P(Z \geq |z|)\)`.

---

### Hypothesis testing using `\(t\)`-tests


- So far, we have assumed that the population variance
`\(\sigma^{2}\)` is known. 

- In reality,
`\(\sigma^{2}\)` is almost always unknown, and we need to estimate it from
the data. 

- As before, we estimate `\(\sigma^{2}\)` using the sample variance
`\(S^{2}\)`. 

- Similar to our approach
for finding confidence intervals, we account for this additional source
of uncertainty by using the `\(t\)`-distribution with `\(n-1\)` degrees of
freedom instead of the standard normal distribution. 

- The hypothesis
testing procedure is then called the `\(t\)`-test.


---

### Hypothesis testing using `\(t\)`-tests


- Using the observed values of `\(\bar{X}\)` and `\(S\)`, the observed value of
the test statistic is obtained as follows: `\(t  =  \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}}\)`.

- We refer to `\(t\)` as the `\(t\)`-*score*. Then,
`$$\begin{array}{l@{\quad}l}
\mbox{if}\ H_{A}: \mu &lt; \mu _0, &amp;  p_{\mathrm{obs}} = P(T \leq t), \\
\mbox{if}\ H_{A}: \mu &gt; \mu _0, &amp; p_{\mathrm{obs}} = P(T \geq t ), \\
\mbox{if}\ H_{A}: \mu \ne \mu _0, &amp; p_{\mathrm{obs}} = 2 \times P\bigl(T \geq | t | \bigr),
\end{array}$$`

- Here, `\(T\)` has a `\(t\)`-distribution with `\(n-1\)` degrees of freedom, and `\(t\)`
is our observed `\(t\)`-score. 


---

### Hypothesis testing for population proportion


- For a binary random variable `\(X\)` with possible values 0 and 1, we are
typically interested in evaluating hypotheses regarding the population
proportion of the outcome of interest, denoted as `\(X=1\)`. 
 
- As discussed before, the population proportion is the same as the population mean for such binary variables.

- So we follow the same procedure as described above. 
- More specifically,
we use the `\(z\)`-test for hypothesis testing. 


---

### Hypothesis testing for population proportion

- Note that we do not use
`\(t\)`-test, because for binary random variable, population variance is
`\(\sigma^{2}=\mu(1-\mu)\)`. 
- Therefore, by setting `\(\mu=\mu_{0}\)` according
to the null hypothesis, we also specify the population variance as
`\(\sigma^{2} = \mu_{0}(1-\mu_{0})\)`.

---

### Hypothesis testing for population proportion

- If we assume that the null hypothesis is true, we have
`$$\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}| H_{0}  \sim  N\bigl(\mu_{0},  \mu_{0}(1-\mu_{0})/n\bigr).
\end{equation*}$$`
- This means that
`$$\begin{equation*}
Z  =  \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_{0}}{\sqrt{ \mu_{0}(1-\mu_{0})/n}} \sim N(0, 1).
\end{equation*}$$`
- As a result, we obtain the `\(z\)`-score as follows, where `\(p\)` is the sample proportion (mean)
`$$\begin{equation*}
z = \frac{p - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\mu_0(1-\mu_0)/n}},
\end{equation*}$$`
