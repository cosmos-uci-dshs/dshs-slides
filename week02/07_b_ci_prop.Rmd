# Now, let's flip things a bit 

- I do not show you the candy machine or give you any details about it
- I show you one random sample with 25 candy.

- What is best guess/estimate for the proportion of orange candy in the candy machine from which I got my sample?


???
- you can type up your answer in the chat, but wait till i tell you to hit enter
- Put your guesses in the chat
- Since you have one sample proportion (= .4), you probably used it as a point estimate of the population proportion I am asking you to guess.

## Quite rare to hit the exact population parameter 
if you simply use the sample statistic  as a point estimate of the population parameter you are trying to estimate. 

---

## This is what happens in reality: 

- You only have one sample - the data that you have observed/collected.
- You do not know the population distribution or parameters. 
- and you need to make _inferences_ about the population parameters based on the one sample you have.

## Ideas to improve our guesstimate so that we are more likely to include the true population parameter ?

- Think about reasons why using `point estimate` as our guess, we will rarely guess the true population parameter correctly?
    - **Sampling variability**
- If incorporate sampling variability into our guess by  report a range of plausible values around the point estimate, we have a good shot that the range of values  captures the true proportion of orange candy in the candy machine 

---
class: middle 
### How should we incorporate sampling variability (SE) into our estimate/guess for the true population proportion $p$ ?
    

- By CLT, under certain conditions, $\hat{p} \sim  \text{approximately } N(\text{mean} = p, \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}})$
- SE of sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be estimated to be $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ since we do not know the true $p$  and by CLT we can assume $\hat{p}$ is close to $p$.

class: middle 
# Confidence intervals

-  are interval estimates (rather than point estimates) that are used to estimate the population parameter
- includes a plausible range of values for the population parameter by incorporating SE to the point estimate.
- are calculated at desired levels of confidence generally 95%,99%, 90%, 80% etc

---
###  95% Confidence Interval  for one proportion

$$\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$ 
- we estimated SE of $\hat{p}$ to be $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ 
- we assume $\hat{p} \sim  \text{approximately normal }$ 
- For a normal distribution 95% of the data falls within `1.96` standard deviations of the mean.

# Activity 2: Simulating Confidence Intervals
We will draw candy samples of size 25 from the candy machine with $p = 0.57$, build a confidence intervals for each sample and study the confidence intervals 


1. Go [here](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/confsim/ConfSim.html)
2. In **Describe process:**
set Statistic = Proportions, Distribution = Binomial, Method = Walds ( since we are using the z-interval), $p$, the population proportion = 0.57, sample size = 25, number of intervals = 1
3. Confidence interval = 95%
4. Click the button Sample a few times

# Why do we say 95% confidence ? 

Suppose we take many samples and build a confidence interval corresponding to each sample using the equation 

`point estimate ± 1.96×SE`.

then 


- about **95%** of all these intervals we constructed would **contain the true population proportion** $p$ (which is 0.57 in our example) 
- about 5% of all these intervals would not contain the true population proportion $p$


---
class: middle
In other words, to guess the **unknown population parameter**, 

if we use the equation `point estimate ± 1.96×SE` instead of  just guessing `point estimate`,

then the interval we provide will correctly include the unknown population parameter 95% of the time. 

That is **awesome** considering that guessing using just the `point estimate` would most often be wrong ! :-)

# Things about Confidence levels

class: middle

# Confidence levels

Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, 98%, and 99%.

A confidence interval can be calculated using the formula

$$ \text{point estimate} \pm z^\star \times \text{SE} $$ 


- $z^\star$ is called the critical value.
- $z^\star \times SE$ is called the _margin of error_
- width of CI = 2 X margin of error

---
class: middle

#  Width of a confidence interval

If we want to be more certain that we capture the population parameter, i.e. increase our confidence level, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?

--

_A wider interval._

class: middle

### Can you see any drawbacks to using a wider interval?

# Changing confidence levels 

$$ \text{point estimate} \pm z^\star \times \text{SE} $$ 

In the above formula, for a given sample, 

- point estimate is the sample statistic ( $\hat{p}$ )
- SE is the standard error which is approx $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ 

Thus, as confidence level changes **only** 
-  $z^\star$ in the above formula needs to be adjusted according to confidence level

# Width of the confidence interval 

CI = $\text{point estimate} \pm \text { critical value} \times \text{standard error}$

- Higher level of confidence means larger critical value.
- Larger critical value means higher margin of error.
- Higher margin of error means wider CI.

Thus 99% CI would be the wider compared to 95% CI

| Proportion                    | $p$                 | $\hat{p}$                               |z             | $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$                         |
| Mean                          | $\mu$                 | $\bar x$                          |z for large n or t for small n          | $\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}$                         |


$p$ is the sample proportion,
$\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, 
$s^2$ is the sample variance.

Confidence intervals are ...


- interval estimates for population parameters constructed from a sample 
- only about population parameters, not individual observations
- confidence is in the process used to generate the confidence intervals 
- confidence is not in the fact that the confidence interval contains or does not contain the population parameter

.important[There is no probability associated with a confidence interval. Either the population parameter is in the interval or not.]
