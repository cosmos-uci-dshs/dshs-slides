## Data Science 

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

alzheimer_data <- read.csv('data/nacc_data_processed.csv') %>% 
  select(id, diagnosis, age, educ, female, height, weight) %>% 
  mutate(diagnosis = as.factor(diagnosis), female = as.factor(female))

```

- Data-intensive studies have led to a new paradigm in scientific research. 

- Within this new paradigm, however, there are many new challenges involving analysis of big data due to large-scale scientific studies, routine use of digital sensors, and intensive computer simulations.

- To tackle these emerging challenges, the field of __data science__ brings together _statistics, computer science_, and _mathematics_ to solve data intensive problems.

- At its core, data science relies on statistical methods to solve scientific problems. These methods have their foundation in mathematics and are implemented using computational techniques.

## Some general terminologies

- To study a population, we measure a set of characteristics, which we refer to as __variables__.
- The objective of many scientific studies is to
learn about the __variation__ of a specific characteristic
(e.g., BMI, disease status) in the population of interest. 
- In many studies, we are interested in possible __relationships__ among different variables.
- We refer to the variables that are the main focus of our study as the
__response__ (or target) variables. 
- In contrast, we call variables that explain or predict the variation in the response variable as
__explanatory__ variables or __predictors__ depending on the role of these variables.
- Statistical analysis begins with a scientific problem usually presented
in the form of a __hypothesis testing__, __estimation__, or __prediction__
problem.

## Study design

If possible, before we conduct our study, we need to design it in order to (Cox and Donnelly, 2011)
  + avoid systematic error
  
  + reduce non-systematic error
  
  + ensure the scale of effort is appropriate; Goldilocks rule: not too limited, not too wasteful, just right!

## Common study designs

- Survey studies: Researchers collect information from individuals through some questions

- Observational studies: Researchers are passive examiners, trying to have the least impact on the data collection process.  

- Experiments: Researchers attempt to control the process as much as possible.


---

## Sampling design

- We cannot of course observe the whole population of interest or conduct experiments on them. 

- Instead, we select a __sample__ of representative members from the population.

- Then with the methods of __statistical inference__, the conclusions based on the sample can cautiously be attributed to the whole population.

---

## Sampling design

Some sampling schemes:

- Simple random sampling

- Stratified sampling

- Cluster sampling

- Multi-stage and temporal sampling


---


## Statistical inference

- We collect data on a sample from the population in order to learn about the whole population. 
- Note that in general the characteristics, relationships, and realities in the whole population always remain unknown. 
- Therefore, there is always some __uncertainty__ associated with our inference. 
- In Statistics, the mathematical tool to address uncertainty is __probability__. 
- The process of using the data to draw conclusions about the whole population, while acknowledging the extent of our uncertainty about our findings, is called __statistical inference__. 
- The knowledge we acquire from data through statistical inference allows us to make decisions with respect to the scientific problem that
motivated our study and our data analysis.

## Variables

Variables `age`, `height`, and `weight` are __numerical variables__. 

--

We can do certain analyses using these variables such as finding an average or the maximum or minimum meaningfully.

--

Not everything represented by numbers represents a numeric quantity. e.g. `diagnosis`, `female`.

--

These are are __categorical variables__. 

--

Categorical variables have __levels__. For instance `diagnosis` has three levels.

---

class: middle

`character`: takes string values (e.g. a person's name, address)

--

`integer`: integer (single precision)  

--

`double`: floating decimal (double precision) 

--

`numeric`: integer or double  

--

`factor`: categorical variables with different levels  

--

`logical`: TRUE (1), FALSE (0)
