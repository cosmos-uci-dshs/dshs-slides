## Outline


1. Describing Categorical Data 

2. Describing Numerical Data 

<hr>

- We will only summarize a single variable at a time but later we will talk about relationship between two variables.
- First we will summarize data with numbers and later we will summarize it with visuals.

## Summarizing Categorical Data

Categorical data are often summarized with a frequency table.

__Counts__ or __proportions__ are used to summarize categorical variables. 

.center[

<table align = "center">
<thead>
  <th> </th>
  <th>TRUE </th>
  <th> FALSE </th>
  <th> Total Count </th>

</thead>

<tr>
<td>fruity </td>
<td> 47</td>
<td> 38</td>
<td> 85</td>


</tr>

</table>

<br>

<table align = "center" >

  <th> FALSE </th>
  <th> Total Proportion </th>

<tr>
<td>fruity </td>
<td> 0.5529412</td>
<td> 0.4470588</td>
<td> 1</td>

## Summarizing Numerical Data

Consider the following data which represents the number of hours slept for 10 people who were surveyed.

.center[
<table>

<tr>

<td> 7 </td>
<td> 7.5 </td>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 5.5 </td>
<td> 10 </td>
<td> 7.2 </td>
<td> 7 </td>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 9 </td>
<td> 8 </td>


</tr>




</table>

]

## Mean

$$\bar x = \frac{7+7.5+8+5.5+10+7.2+7+8+9+8}{10} = 7.72$$

The mean is calculated by summing the observed values and then dividing by the number of observations.

.formula[
$$\bar x = \frac{x_1 + x_2+.... x_n}{n}$$
]

where $\bar x$ represents the mean of observed values, $x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_n$ represent the n observed values.

---

class: middle

## Median

If all the observations are listed from smallest to largest (or vice versa), the median is the observation that falls in the middle. 

.center[

<table>

<tr>

<td> 5.5 </td>
<td> 7 </td>
<td> 7 </td>
<td> 7.2 </td>
<td> 7.5 </td>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 9 </td>
<td> 10 </td>


</tr>


</table>

]

In this case, we have two numbers in the middle 7.5 and 8. The average of these numbers would be the median. In this case, the median is 7.75. 

$$\frac{7.5 + 8}{2} = 7.75$$

--

Median is also the 50th percentile indicating that 50% of the data fall below this value.

---

class: middle

## Q1, Q3, and Interquartile Range

First quartile (Q1) is the point at which 25% of the data fall below of. 

Third quartile (Q3) is the point at which 75% of the data fall below of. 

Q1 and Q3 can be considered 25th and 75th percentiles respectively. 

.formula[Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1] which represents the middle 50% of the data.

## In Breakout Rooms: Question 1

Consider the mean, median, Q1, and Q3 of everyone's height in this cluster. 
You don't need to know the exact values.
LeBron James decides to join our cluster. 
How would the mean, median, Q1, and Q3 change if at all?

---

class: middle

## In Breakout Rooms: Question 2

Actually LeBron James does not join but Peter Dinklage is joining. 
How would the mean, median, Q1, and Q3 of heights change if at all?

---

## In Breakout Rooms: Question 3

Consider Dr. Dogucu teaching three classes. 
All of these classes have 5 students. 
Below are exam results from these classes. 

Class 1: 80 80 80 80 80  
Class 2: 76 78 80 82 84  
Class 3: 60 70 80 90 100  

All of these classes have a mean of 80 points. 
Do you think the mean describes these classes well? 
Can you think of any other way to describe (in words not in numbers) how these classes differ?

## Total distance from the mean


$\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2 =$

$4.9284 + 0.5184 + 0.5184 + 0.2704 + 0.0484 +$ 
$0.0784 + 0.0784 + 0.0784+ 1.6384 + 5.1984 = 13.356 \text{ hr}^2$

Note that $n$ represents sample size here thus $n = 10$.

## Sample variance

<br>    
.formula[

$$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}$$ 

]

<br>

$$s^2= \frac{13.356}{10-1} = 1.484\text{ hr}^2$$

---

## Sample standard deviation

<br>
.formula[
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}}$$
]

<br>
$$s= \sqrt{1.484} = 1.218195 \text{ hr}$$

## Summarizing Categorical Data

__Counts__ or __proportions__ are used to summarize categorical variables. 



---

## Counts in R

```{r}
count(ncbirths, premie)
```

There are 342 people who premie and 549 who did not. 

---

## Proportions in R


```{r}
tabyl(ncbirths, premie)
```


---

## Mean in R

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, mean(weight))
```

---

## Median in R

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, median(weight))
```


---

## Quartiles

You can specify quartiles (Q3)

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, quantile(weight, 0.75))
```

Recall that 75% of the data is below Q3. Thus the 0.75 quantile in the R code.

---

## Standard Deviation and Variance

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, sd(weight))
```

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, var(weight))
```

---

class: middle

We have seen multiple summary statistics. 
The `summarize()` function can support all of them at once.

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, mean(weight), median(weight), 
          sd(weight), var(weight))
```

---

class: middle

We can also define variable names for the summary statistics that get printed out (e.g. `mean_weight`).

```{r}
summarize(ncbirths, mean_weight = mean(weight), 
          med_weight = median(weight), 
          sd_weight = sd(weight), 
          var_weight = var(weight))
```

---

## Missing Data (NA)

```{r error=TRUE}
summarize(ncbirths, mean(visits))
```

--

```{r error=TRUE}
summarize(ncbirths, mean(visits, na.rm = TRUE))
```
